# ⏳ Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model. It covers the full cycle of time series analysis, from data preprocessing to building and validating the ARIMA model for accurate future predictions.

## 📁 Project Overview

The notebook includes:

* Data import and preprocessing
* Exploratory time series analysis
* Stationarity testing and differencing
* Auto-correlation (ACF) and partial auto-correlation (PACF) plots
* ARIMA model fitting
* Model diagnostics and forecast visualization

## 📊 Techniques Used

* **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test** for checking stationarity
* **ACF/PACF** plots to determine AR and MA terms
* **ARIMA(p,d,q)** model fitting using `statsmodels`
* Train/test split for validation
* Residual diagnostics for model performance evaluation

## 📦 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Statsmodels

## 📈 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this notebook is a univariate time series containing timestamped observations (e.g., sales, temperature, stock prices, etc.).

Common columns might include:

* `Date/Time`: timestamp of the observation
* `Value`: the quantity being forecasted

> The notebook may also handle datetime indexing and frequency resampling to make the time series consistent.

## 🔍 Key Learnings

* Importance of making a time series stationary
* Selecting the right ARIMA order `(p,d,q)`
* Using residuals and plots to diagnose forecast quality
* Visualizing future trends using ARIMA predictions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `Time series Forecasting with ARIMA.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
3. Follow the step-by-step code blocks to run and modify forecasting for your own dataset

## 📌 Use Cases

* Forecasting future sales or demand
* Predicting temperature or environmental trends
* Stock price movement prediction
* Any univariate time series forecasting task
